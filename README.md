## Features

### Tournament Management
- **9 Formats**: Round Robin, Elimination (KO), Random Doubles, Group Stage + KO, Swiss System, Double Elimination, Monrad, King of the Court, Waterfall
- **Format Info Modal**: Detailed description with ASCII diagram and pros/cons for every format
- **3 Modes**: Singles, Doubles, Mixed
- **5 Point Systems** (independently configurable): 11 Pts Hard Cap, 11 Pts Ext. to 20, 15 Pts Hard Cap, 15 Pts Ext. to 25, 21 Pts Ext. to 30 (default)
- **Sets to Win** (independently configurable): Best of 1, Best of 3, Best of 5 — stored separately from the point system so any combination is possible
- All auto-fill, validation, and winner logic adapts automatically to the selected point system and sets-to-win
- **Tournament Wizard**: Step-by-step creation with tab navigation (Settings -> Players -> Teams -> Seeding -> Create)
  - Auto-save on every step - no data loss when navigating between tabs
  - Draft summary showing all settings and participants before starting
  - Start button only enabled after wizard completion and team validation
  - Club filter + gender filter + search for player selection
  - Auto-focus search after selection for rapid player picking; search text auto-selected so next query can be typed immediately
  - Selected players shown as colored chips (blue/pink by gender)
- **Manual Team Pairing**: Click two players to form a team in Doubles/Mixed
  - Mixed mode: Women/Men in separate columns, same gender greyed out
  - "Auto-assign remaining" for quick fill
  - Teams are persisted and restored when editing
  - Tournament creation blocked until all teams are formed
- **Separate KO Scoring**: When starting the KO phase in Group + KO format, a modal allows optionally setting a different point system and sets-to-win for KO rounds (e.g. Best of 1 in groups, Best of 3 in KO)
- **Smart KO Qualification**: Configurable KO bracket size (4/8/16/32), auto-filled with best runners-up across groups
- **Percentage-based Standings**: Match win %, set win %, point win %
- **Entry Fee Management**: Smart per-person or per-team billing
  - Fixed teams (KO, Group+KO, Double Elimination): one payment per team, partner auto-marked as paid
  - Non-fixed teams + Singles: individual payment per player
  - Payment status per player (Cash, Transfer, PayPal) with editable date
  - Paid (green) and open (red) amounts visible in header
  - Overview with total sum, grouped by club
- **Seeding**: Pick exactly which players are seeded via per-player checkbox (opt-in, nothing seeded by default), then order them via Drag & Drop or arrow keys — supported for KO, Double-KO, and Group Stage + KO (singles); unseeded players are drawn randomly
  - **Snake distribution for groups**: 4 groups + 8 seeds → G1=[1,8], G2=[2,7], G3=[3,6], G4=[4,5] — top seeds are spread evenly instead of clashing early
- **Template System** (v2, cross-PC transfer): Export/import tournaments as JSON files
  - Selectable: Settings, Players, Teams (individually or combined)
  - **Full player records** (first name, last name, gender, birth date, club) are exported — not just display names
  - **Auto-create on import**: Players that don't exist on the target PC are automatically created in the player database
  - **ID remapping**: Teams are re-linked through an internal ID map so team pairings survive cross-PC transfer even when player IDs differ
  - **Hall config** (multi-hall setups with court counts) is preserved
  - **Summary modal** after import shows how many players were matched / newly created / skipped, and how many team pairings were transferred
  - Backward compatible with v1 templates (full name is split into first + last name)
  - Export uses native save dialog in the packaged app (EXE/DMG)
  - **Import button** on the Tournaments list page — opens native file dialog, creates tournament with all settings pre-filled and matching players already added, then navigates straight to the wizard
- **Archiving**: Archive and restore completed tournaments
- **Reopen Tournament**: Reactivate accidentally ended tournaments
- **Undo Last Round**: Delete the last round and go back — in Group + KO format, undoing the KO round restores the group phase (Start KO button reappears), undoing all group rounds resets to pre-start state
- **Injury/Retirement with Undo**: Mark players as injured (walkovers for open matches), restore for future rounds (walkovers preserved)
- **Attendance Check**: Before the draw runs, a modal lists all registered players with checkboxes (all checked by default). Uncheck absent players — they are removed from the tournament before the draw, resulting in fewer byes and a fairer bracket
- **Auto-Naming**: Tournament name auto-generated from date + mode + format, editable
- **Save Confirmation**: Green toast notification confirms all changes (settings, players, teams, halls) were saved after editing a tournament draft
- **Unified Toast Notifications**: A global toast context (`useToast`) replaces native browser alerts for save confirmations, import summaries, and error reporting across the app — non-blocking, stackable, auto-dismissing

### Self-Healing Schema Check (v2.7.3)
- **Resilient to incomplete migrations**: On every DB connect a defensive `ensureExpectedSchema` pass runs `PRAGMA table_info` against `tournaments` + `tournament_players` and adds any missing column the JS code expects (`cap`, `ko_points_per_set`, `ko_sets_to_win`, `ko_cap`, `venue_id`, `min_rest_minutes`, `enable_third_place` on tournaments; `retired`, `payment_status`, `payment_method`, `paid_date`, `seed_rank` on tournament_players). Idempotent — no-op when migrations ran cleanly. Fixes "table tournaments has no column named cap" errors that surfaced after restoring an old DB backup or moving the DB file across BOSS versions, where `tauri-plugin-sql` had stopped halfway through the migration chain. Each ALTER TABLE is `try/catch`-wrapped so an isolated quirk on one column can't abort the rest

### Group-Phase Sync, Restructured TV Mode &amp; Live Push Fixes (v2.7.2)
- **Smart court queue**: During `Group + KO` group phase, the unassigned-match queue is grouped by group and ordered by remaining-match count (largest backlog on top). The tournament director naturally picks from the lagging group first → all groups finish around the same time before KO can start. Queue spans all groups even when a single group round is "active" — picking a round button no longer hides the other groups
- **Per-group progress bar**: Compact bar above the round selector showing each group's `<completed>/<total>`, with embedded read-only round pills (`[1✓][2✓][3]`) for at-a-glance status. Lagging groups get a ⚠ icon. Visible during the group phase and stays as a history reference once KO has started (all-emerald, all ✓). Replaces the old per-group round buttons that no longer made sense once the queue spans all groups
- **Group tab — match log per round**: When drilling into a single group on the Gruppen tab, a "Partien" card now lists every match segmented per round (Runde 1/2/3 with mini-headers), with sets won + per-set point detail and a winner highlight. Tables share `table-fixed` column widths so all rounds align column-by-column. The "Beendet" toggle on the Spiele tab is now a simple show/hide collapse instead of a two-mode switch
- **TV mode rebuilt** on the same data helpers as the main view: per-group progress strip in the header, smart-queue grouped (max 5 visible per group + `+N more`), seed badges (`S1`/`S2`/…) on court and queue cards, dedicated 🥉 section for the bronze playoff, multi-hall support with hall headers + locally-numbered courts (Halle B → "Court 1"), per-card round/group context label (`G1·R3` / Halbfinale / 🥉 Bronze), read-only player-conflict marker (🚫), recent results segmented per group during group phase. Also fixed a hooks-order regression that turned the page white on first load
- **Live publishing — WordPress plugin v1.0.2**: `[boss_matches]` was only ever rendering the *current* round, hiding every completed match in earlier rounds. Now segmented one section per round across the whole tournament with human-readable headings (`Group 1 — Round 2`, `Quarterfinal`, `Semifinal`, `Final`, `🥉 Third Place`, `Winners — Round 1`, …), inline status sort (Live → Pending → Done), and **two score columns**: Sets won (`2:0`) plus per-set detail (`21:18, 21:15`). Standings + per-round match tables now use `table-layout: fixed` with explicit `<colgroup>` widths so all groups and all rounds line up column-by-column instead of drifting based on the longest player name. Plugin version bump = automatic browser cache-bust on the next page load
- **Bronze toggle pre-checked for new tournaments**: regression from v2.7.1 fixed — the "Spiel um Platz 3 austragen" checkbox now reflects the real default (ON for KO formats) when starting a new tournament, instead of always being unchecked

### KO &amp; Match-Flow Polish (v2.7.1)
- **Spiel um Platz 3 (Bronze playoff)**: Per-tournament toggle (default ON for new KO tournaments). When the semi-finals complete, a bronze match is auto-created alongside the Final. Works for `Elimination`, `Group Stage + KO`, and `Double Elimination` (Bronze = LB-final loser vs. LB-semifinal loser there). Rendered as a dedicated 🥉 panel below the bracket and a separate round button in the Spiele tab. Scope can be flipped off in the wizard for events that skip 3rd place
- **Seed badges in tournament view**: Players that received a seed in the wizard now show a compact `S1` / `S2` / … badge next to their name in the **Gruppen-Tab** (singles + doubles tables) and the **Verwaltungs-Tab**. Seed rank is now persisted per-tournament-player (was previously thrown away after the bracket draw), so the information survives the tournament lifecycle
- **Player-on-court conflict guard**: When the next round is drawn early and a player is still active on another court, the affected match is hard-blocked from being assigned to a court. The waiting card shows a 🚫 marker, the dropdown disables conflicted courts, and a rose-themed modal lists which players are still on which court — no bypass (unlike the rest-time warning), since two simultaneous matches with the same player would never finish
- **Bronze toggle pre-checked for new tournaments**: Fixed a regression where "Spiel um Platz 3 austragen" was unchecked by default after creating a new tournament — initial draft creation now sets the flag honestly so the wizard checkbox reflects the real default

### Live Publishing to WordPress (v2.7.0)
- **Per-tournament opt-in**: Each tournament has its own "📡 Live aktivieren" toggle in the detail view — off by default. Multiple parallel tournaments can run live independently, each pushing under its own ID
- **Connection setup once**: Endpoint URL + shared secret are stored in Settings → "Live-Veroeffentlichung (WordPress)". A "Test connection" button verifies the WP plugin responds
- **Tournament ID badge**: The Live button displays the tournament ID (`ID: 42`) so the WordPress shortcode (`[boss_matches id="42"]`) can be assembled without searching — tooltip even shows the ready-to-paste shortcode template
- **Event-driven push**: Snapshots are pushed within ~1.5s of any state change (score, court assignment, match completion, round draw) plus a 60s heartbeat as a liveness signal. A signature hash skips redundant heartbeats when nothing changed
- **Stop publishing**: Click the active "📡 Live aktiv" button → confirm modal → opt-in is removed AND a delete request is sent so the WordPress page drops the snapshot. Even if the WP server is offline, opt-in is removed locally so no further pushes are attempted
- **Companion WordPress plugin** (`/wordpress-plugin/boss-live-results/`): Single-file PHP plugin with REST endpoint, custom post type for snapshot storage, and 5 shortcodes — `[boss_tournaments]` (list), `[boss_matches id]`, `[boss_standings id]`, `[boss_bracket id]`, `[boss_status id]`. Vanilla-JS frontend polls every 15s, no React/jQuery dependency
- **Privacy-aware**: Only first name, last name, and club are transmitted. Birth dates and payment info are deliberately stripped before push — DSGVO-friendly, public sites must not expose member PII
- **Hardened**: Outbound HTTP is allowed only to `*/wp-json/boss/v1/*` (Tauri capability allowlist). Authentication via `X-BOSS-Secret` header (constant-time `hash_equals` on the WP side)

### Player Management
- **First Name + Last Name** as separate fields
- **Date of Birth** with auto-calculated age
- **Club** with autocomplete dropdown (existing clubs suggested, free text for new)
- **Excel Import** (ExcelJS) with column mapping and fuzzy duplicate detection (Levenshtein-based similarity catches near-matches like "Schmidt" vs "Schmitt")
  - Column headers auto-detected by name (DE + EN keywords) and pre-mapped — fully overridable
  - No data splitting: First Name and Last Name always stay in separate columns as imported
  - Live preview in the mapping step shows First Name and Last Name as separate columns
  - DD.MM.YYYY, YYYY-MM-DD, MM/DD/YYYY date formats auto-detected
- **Excel Import in Tournament Wizard**: Import players directly during creation, all auto-selected
- **Excel Export** with native save dialog (First Name, Last Name, Date of Birth, Age, Club)
- **Sortable Columns**: Click headers to sort by first name or last name (ascending/descending)
- **Gender Filter + Search** for player selection
- **Injury/Retirement**: Styled modal with team impact warning; fixed teams exclude partner automatically, random doubles exclude only the injured player
- **Remove Player Confirmation**: Deleting a player from the central player database now goes through a styled confirm modal (no more native `confirm()` popup) listing the player name; the list page stays responsive because the delete runs as an async action with spinner feedback

### Venues
- **Halls with individual court counts**: Each venue has multiple halls, each hall its own courts
- Inline hall editor: name + court count per hall, add/remove
- **JSON Export/Import**: Export and import venues as files (native save dialog in packaged app)
- **Tournament Integration**: Select venue during creation, choose halls via checkbox; venue selection is persisted and restored when editing a tournament draft
- **Grouped Court Display**: Courts in tournament grouped by hall with section headers
- **Default Halls in Settings**: Applied when no venue is selected

### Match Operations
- **Court Assignment**: Drag & Drop or double-click to assign matches to courts
  - Occupied courts detected and blocked (consistent across rounds)
  - Double-click on waiting match: court selection popup (with 1 free court: direct assignment)
  - Double-click on occupied court: scrolls to match and focuses first input
  - Timer starts automatically on assignment, shows duration in accent color
  - Score entry only possible after court assignment
- **Smart Match View**: Automatic sorting by status
  - "On Court": Running matches with full score entry
  - "Completed": Compact one-liners with set score + individual points (e.g. 2:0 (21:15, 21:18)), expandable
  - 3-second delay: freshly completed matches stay visible before sliding down
  - Edited matches stay in the completed section (no jumping up)
- **Auto-Fill Score**: Badminton rally point system — auto-fills opponent score based on active scoring mode
- **Score Validation**: Invalid results detected and marked
- **Match Winner Auto-Reset**: Correcting a score automatically resets the winner
- **Fair Draw**: With odd player count, the player with most matches sits out; with random doubles, previous partnerships weighted to avoid repetition
- **Early Round Draw**: For Random Doubles and Round Robin (doubles/mixed), the next round can be drawn as soon as one match of the current round is completed — no need to wait for all courts to finish. New matches appear in the court queue under a "— Round N —" separator and are immediately assignable to free courts
- **Court Timer**: Configurable warning (yellow) and critical (red) thresholds
- **Minimum Rest Time**: Optional per-tournament setting (minutes) — when assigning a match to a court, a warning modal lists any player who hasn't rested long enough since their last completed match with the remaining minutes, giving the tournament director a clear info base with an "Assign anyway" bypass
- **Resting Player Indicator**: While a player's rest interval is still running, a small clock icon (⏱) appears next to their name everywhere they show up during the tournament — match cards, court overview, TV mode, and KO bracket. Hover shows remaining minutes. The icon auto-disappears after one minute without a refresh and incurs zero cost when `min_rest_minutes = 0`.

### TV/Projector Mode
- **Separate fullscreen window** optimized for landscape and distance readability
- **Badminton Court SVG** background on court cards
- **Live Timer** on each court, match queue, recent results with winner highlighting
- **Player Announcement Banner** with animation ("Please go to court!")
- **5-second polling** with bulk queries for performance
- Adapts to selected color theme
- **F11** = fullscreen toggle, **Escape** = close window

### Statistics Dashboard
- **Tournament Overview**: Total tournaments by status, format distribution, mode distribution
- **Match Statistics**: Completed matches, average/longest/shortest duration, avg points per set, closest match
- **Court Utilization**: Courts used, matches per court, average time per court
- **Player Demographics**: Gender split, age distribution, top clubs
- **Cross-tournament Player Rankings**: Win rate, points per match, medals for Top 3
- **Tournament Filter**: View stats for all tournaments or a specific one

### Standings & Evaluation
- **Percentage-based Rankings**: Match win %, set win %, point win %
- **Group Tables**: Separate table per group with qualifier marking (Q)
- **Smart KO Qualification**: Configurable bracket size (4/8/16/32), auto-filled with best runners-up
- **Medals**: Gold/Silver/Bronze for Top 3
- **Tournament Report**: Printable report with highlights (closest match, biggest win, most points)
- **Print View**: Match schedule, current round, standings or complete report
- **PDF Export**: Save tournament report as PDF
- **Certificate Generator**: Festive certificates for Top 3 (gold border, BOSS branding, signature line)

### Language
- **English** (default) and **German**
- Language selection in Settings
- Instant switch, persistently saved

### Design & Themes
- **4 Color Themes**: Emerald (Green), Sapphire (Blue), Amber (Orange), Dark (Dark Mode)
- **5 Fonts**: Inter, Nunito, Roboto, Poppins, Montserrat (all bundled locally for offline use)
- **7 Font Sizes**: XXS, XS, S, M, L, XL, XXL - persistently saved
- Full **Dark Mode**: All pages, modals, inputs, tables, bracket view
- **Custom Club Logo**: Upload with crop tool (1:1 cropper, 500KB limit), stored in SQLite (included in backups)
- **Badminton Court SVG**: Subtle court background on court cards
- Theme-aware print view adapts to selected color scheme

### Usability
- **Dynamic Document Titles**: Browser/window title reflects the current page (e.g. `BOSS - Tournament Name`, `BOSS - Players`, `BOSS - Settings`) so it is obvious which window is which when running multiple BOSS instances
- **Loading States**: Long-running actions (tournament create, template import, Excel import, database reset) show inline spinners and disable their trigger buttons; no more double-clicks kicking off duplicate work
- **Form Validation**: Number inputs (entry fee, rest time, court counts, timer thresholds) now enforce `required / min / max` bounds at the input level, surfacing the native browser validation UI before the action runs

### Settings
- **Auto-Update**: Automatic check on app start (banner notification), manual check in Settings
- **Language**: English / German selection
- **Design**: 4 color themes, 5 fonts, 7 font sizes, custom club logo with cropper
- **Defaults**: Default courts, timer thresholds (warning yellow, critical red)
- **Database**: Show/change storage location, backup & restore
- **Credits**: Collapsible section listing idea & development authors, extensible for future contributors
- **Danger Zone**: Delete all players, delete all tournaments, or full database reset (DROP + CREATE with safety confirmation)

### Technical
- **Cross-Platform**: Windows + macOS (Intel + Apple Silicon) via native builds
- **Auto-Update**: Signed releases from GitHub, automatic check on start, manual check in Settings
- **Offline-capable**: Runs completely locally, no internet needed (fonts bundled)
- **SQLite** with foreign key enforcement (PRAGMA)
- **Bulk queries** for TV mode and performance-critical paths
- **Cryptographic randomization**: `crypto.getRandomValues` for fair draws
- **pnpm** package manager
- **GitHub Actions CI/CD** for cross-platform builds
- **ExcelJS** for Excel import/export (replaced vulnerable xlsx/SheetJS)
- **Restricted filesystem scope**: Only $APPDATA, $DOWNLOAD, $DESKTOP, $DOCUMENT accessible
- **i18n Sanity Script**: `pnpm run check:i18n` verifies that every translation key declared in `types.ts` exists in both `de.ts` and `en.ts` and reports missing/extra/unused keys — part of the release checklist

## Prerequisites

For development:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18+)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)
- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) (stable)
- [Visual Studio Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) with C++ Workload (Windows)

For using the app:

- Windows 10/11 (x64) or macOS (Intel / Apple Silicon)
- WebView2 Runtime (pre-installed on Windows 10/11)

## Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start development server (opens desktop window)
pnpm tauri dev

# Create release build
pnpm tauri build
```

The first build takes a few minutes as Rust compiles all dependencies. Subsequent builds are much faster.
