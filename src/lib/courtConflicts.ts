// src/lib/courtConflicts.ts
//
// Player-court conflict detection.
//
// When the next round is drawn early, matches from two rounds can sit in the
// queue at the same time. Without an additional guard, the same player could
// be assigned to two courts simultaneously — physically impossible.
//
// These helpers sit between the match list and the UI:
//   - getRunningPlayerCourts: index every player currently on a court.
//   - getMatchConflicts: report which players of a given match would clash
//     with that index.
//
// Both functions are pure and intentionally small so the caller can memoize
// them per render. Filter semantics mirror the court-occupation memo in
// TournamentView (`court != null && status != "completed"`), but indexed by
// player rather than by court.
//
// Used by:
//   - TournamentView.handleCourtChange (hard guard before updateMatchCourt)
//   - TournamentView render (visual blocked-state for queue cards)
//   - CourtOverview drag handlers + queue card render
//   - MatchCard court dropdown (disable options when the match has conflicts)
//
// Note: `team1_p2` and `team2_p2` may be `null` (singles) or `0` (BYE / TBD)
// in legacy data — both are filtered out via `pid > 0`.
